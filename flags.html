                    <h3>Ideation And Sketches</h3>
                    <p>I began this project with research and sketches. I was particularly interested in the history of
                        Crete in addition to the natural beauty of the countryside. Crete is well-known for its Minoan
                        ruins as well as its uniquely Mediterranean climate, and I felt that the direction of my design
                        should reflect that. With that in mind, I began sketching not only the ruins of the island, but
                        also its topography. I also paid particular attention to symbols of mythology associated with
                        the culutre of ancient Crete.</p>

                        <h3>First Pass</h3>
                        <p>This first pass was the culmination of several sketches as well as other assets pulled from
                            prior projects. For example, the palm tree was from an earlier illustrator project that
                            eventually became an after effects video. Further iterations on this design would see
                            multiple sweeping changes, although the underlying aesthetic would remain the same.</p>

                        <p>Crete is an island off of Greece located in the Mediterranean sea, known to be the most
                            populous of the many isles dotting the area. An ancient place, Crete was an established
                            kingdom thousands of years before the modern age, and has a deep and rich history that has
                            inspired myths and other tales throughout ancient times. Now the island is a popular tourist
                            destination known for its beautiful landscapes and beaches, as well as the ruins dotting its
                            landscape that contain many examples of Minoan art.

                        <h3>Thought Process</h3>
                        <p>Although Crete is well known, I have not seen a tourist logo that I felt inspired anyone to
                            visit it. I wanted to incorporate both the landscape and Creteâ€™s history into one image that
                            I felt could evoke an emotion. I wanted a simple image that would inspire a feeling of
                            beauty, but also severity using a bold typeface that demands attention. One of the
                            challenges was colour, as I felt that blues and greens were not evocative of the tranquility
                            I was seeking, and opted instead to choose the colour of the setting sun against the beach
                            and water, as well as the column.</p>
